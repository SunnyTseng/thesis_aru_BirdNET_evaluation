# Evaluation of BirdNET performance across multiple bird species 

In each of its detection, BirdNET provides a confidence value, ranging from 0 to 1, to indicate the likelihood of the inclusion of specific species. When using the audio data for any ecological inference, however, researchers need categorical result (i.e., a bird is presence or absence) instead of continuous values (i.e., confidence value from 0 – 1). Therefore, determining a “threshold” of what confidence values to accept as a positive detection is critical for turning continuous values into categorical result. That is, detection with confidence value higher than a predetermined threshold is categorized as positive detection, otherwise negative detection. The optimal threshold should achieve high precision and high recall, and this optimal threshold might differ among different species. In this study, I will compare the detections made by BirdNET against spectrographically confirmed species identification to determine the optimal thresholds for species occur in John Prince Research Forest. This study can serve as a protocol for future studies applying BirdNET.
